## Audio MNIST Classification

Goal of Study: Classify Audio MNIST data. Please note that, audio data with label 2 has been removed from the training data.

Methods used: 1D-Convolutional Neural Network, 2D-Convolutional Neural Network, Convolutional Variational Autoencoder with Random Forest, Generative Adversarial Network with 2D-Convolutional Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory Network.


#### If you are using Google Colab: Please create a folder named "AudioClassification" in your GoogleDrive and save the data in that folder.

#### If you are running it on your computer please upload the data to Notebook manually. 

### You can download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/audio-classification/data

### GAN with 2D-CNN model achieved the best performance while classifying test data.
